# LangLab Project
LangLab is a Unity tool for prototyping programming languages through an asset based workflow. The goals of this tool are threefold
- Empower artists, gamedesigners and in general people that work with entertainment software to design and implement their own programing languages and especially DSL's.
- Creating languages that targets either the Unity editor, for instance custom scripting languages for game logic, either the actual games produced with Unity, as game features.
- Allowing users to experiments with the powerfull features of the Unity engine to design interactives, visually augmented programming languages, based on gamedesign principles.

# What is an asset based workflow ?
It is a non-standard terminology that in this context, it is the idiomatic workflow that can be found in Unity and other game engines. It allows a smooth collaboration between users from different artistic and technical backgrounds.
It is typically as follow : the user create some self contained scripts called components, and these components can be instanciated and visually combined in the editor.
